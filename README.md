## This code does the following:

Imports the pandas library.

Defines a dictionary called student_dict with student names and scores.

Iterates through student_dict (although it doesn't perform any actions inside the loop).

Converts student_dict into a DataFrame called student_data_frame using pandas.

Reads data from a CSV file into a DataFrame named data.

Creates a dictionary called data_dict that maps letters to codes from the CSV data.

Takes user input for a word and converts it into a list of NATO phonetic alphabet codes using the data_dict.
